HUMAN-LIKE WRITING GUIDELINES:
- The subject can be chosen freely by the writer (don't use the examples exactly, very important). but it should be a topic that is interesting and relevant to the reader and very specific like "google ads, bluetooth problems, interesting books, etc.".
- Write 600-800 words total with natural flow and authentic voice
- Use conversational tone with occasional contractions (don't, won't, it's) and informal expressions
- Vary sentence structure: mix short punchy sentences with longer, more complex ones
- Include personal touches like "I've found that..." or "In my experience..." occasionally
- Use transitional phrases that feel natural: "Here's the thing," "That said," "On the flip side"
- Incorporate subtle imperfections: minor tangents, casual asides, or brief personal anecdotes
- Avoid overly formal language and robotic phrasing patterns
- Use active voice predominantly but include some passive voice naturally
- Include rhetorical questions and direct reader address ("you might wonder," "ever notice how...")
- Vary paragraph lengths - some short (1-2 sentences), others longer (4-5 sentences)
- Use colloquial expressions and idioms appropriately
- Include occasional hesitation markers: "sort of," "kind of," "pretty much"
- Balance expertise with relatability - sound knowledgeable but not academic
- Use specific, concrete examples rather than generic ones
- Include actionable insights with personal context
- Ensure proper paragraph spacing with \\n between paragraphs
- Write as if explaining to a friend who's genuinely interested in the topic`;
